It's important to find the one that's right for your PC and to play around with settings for a smooth frame rate for the best possible experience.

<h3> Should I start by playing against bots? </h3>
 Yes. Jumping into a game with other human players probably just means that both you and the other players in the match are in for a bad time. Despite what you may have heard, bots will never judge you and help you learn the game in a stress-free environment. Starting off with a friend never hurts either. Turbo mode came with the Dota 2 7.07 dueling fates update, its just like a normal game aside with other players but with a very fast exp and gold game and a personal, immortal courier. Great for testing out heroes and builds!

 This is so new players can learn the game with easy to learn heroes (see below) if you wish to disable this, you can enter "dota_new_player 0" into the console.
